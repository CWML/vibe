# It's a Vibe: Using VSCode, GitHub Copilot(AI), & MCP Servers to work more intelligently

A hands-on workshop exploring "vibe coding" - an AI-assisted approach to programming that focuses on what you want to accomplish rather than how to implement it. No matter where you stand with 'vibe coding' – familiar territory or brand new concept – we'll work together to set up tools that enhance your AI-powered workflow. Through hands-on experience with VSCode, GitHub Copilot, and MCP sequential thinking, we'll discover how AI development can transform your daily work.

## Workshop Overview

This repository contains materials for a 1.5-hour interactive workshop designed for students, researchers, graduate students, postdocs, faculty, and data analysts who want to leverage AI tools to accelerate their work. We'll demonstrate real-world applications using fMRI neuroscience data analysis, showing how "vibe coding" transforms complex research workflows.

## What You'll Learn

**Core Concept**: "Vibe coding" lets you describe what you want in natural language and let AI handle the implementation details - perfect for exploratory research and rapid prototyping.

**Tools We'll Master**:
- **VSCode**: Your AI-enhanced development environment
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI-powered code completion and chat assistance  
- **MCP Sequential Thinking**: Step-by-step problem breakdown for complex analyses

**Real Application**: We'll analyze actual fMRI brain imaging data to demonstrate statistical analysis, data visualization, and scientific interpretation - all powered by AI assistance.

## Learning Objectives:

1. Set up a modern development environment with Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

2. Install and configure GitHub Copilot - your AI coding assistant

3. Configure MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server for enhanced AI assistance

4. Investigate potential applications for your work

5. Real Application: We'll analyze actual fMRI brain imaging data to demonstrate statistical analysis, data visualization, and scientific interpretation - all powered by AI assistance.

## Getting Started

1. **Pre-Workshop Setup**: Follow instructions in `pre-class-installation.md`
2. **Workshop Experience**: Work through `Workshop-Updated.ipynb` 
3. **Extended Learning**: Explore `fMRI-EDA-Workshop.ipynb` for deeper analysis

## Target Audience

Researchers, data scientists, and students who want to:
- Accelerate their coding workflows with AI assistance
- Focus more time on scientific insights and less on syntax
- Learn modern tools for enhanced productivity
- Explore AI-assisted data analysis approaches

## Workshop Philosophy
"Vibe coding" may represent a shift from traditional programming paradigms. As Thomas Kuhn described in *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*, we might be witnessing a potential paradigm shift in how we approach software development and computational research. Instead of planning every implementation detail upfront, this approach explores an AI-assisted methodology that emphasizes:

- **Intent over Implementation**: Describe what you want, let AI suggest how
- **Rapid Iteration**: Quick prototyping and testing of ideas
- **Educational AI Use**: Learning while coding through AI explanations
- **Scientific Focus**: More time for research questions, less for debugging

This workshop helps you evaluate whether AI tools truly represent a paradigm shift in your work or simply incremental improvements to existing practices.
